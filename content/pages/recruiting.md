Description: Instructions for Recruiters

Hi and thank you for your interest in reaching out to me!
To save us both time, I've briefly described the kind of job opportunities/requirements that interest me.
If the job you have matches these, then feel free to reach out to me, and I'll do my best to give a prompt reply.
If the job you have doesn't match then feel free to contact me, but don't expect a reply; perhaps sometime in the future my job requirements change and I'll reach out to you.


### Contacting Me

* You *must* provide details on the role and responsibilities for the job through email *before* I will chat over phone. If the role was never going to be a good fit then this save us both 10-20 minutes.
* Do not call me before emailing role information.

### Role and Responsibilities

* I must be able to publish research at top-tier computer science conferences (e.g., [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/)). This is non-negotiable.
* I am primarily interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning research.
* The role should be predominantly about fundamental research and not primarily about software engineering.

### Geographic Location

* I strongly prioritize geographic locations where I can the outdoor activities I love: skiing, rock climbing, and hiking.
* Thus, ideally the role should be in the pacific northwest, west coast, or rocky mountain regions of the United States (e.g., Seattle, Bay Area, Denver etc.).
* Something should be *truly exceptional* about the job for me to move somewhere where enjoying my outdoors interests is difficult (e.g., NYC or DC).
* I *might* entertain international positions depending on details. For example, I've lived in Zurich, Switzerland and loved my time there; I'd strongly consider opportunities in places like that.

### Other

* I am not interested in fixed term contract jobs.
