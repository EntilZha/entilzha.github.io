Description: About Pedro Rodriguez

I am a final year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland at College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/).
I work in the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) with [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/).

My primary research interest in natural language processing is improving Question Answering evaluations through building better datasets, improving evaluation protocols, and re-imagining shared task leaderboards so that they better support longer-term research.
I am also interested in conversational information-seeking, named entity linking and coreference resolution in factually rich text, fact verification, and reproducibility.
I am defending my PhD on "Evaluating Machine Intelligence with Question Answering" in April 2021.
Afterwards, I will be joining Facebook as a research scientist in Seattle.
In my free time, I am an avid skier, climber, and hiker.

## Industry Experience

Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies I have interned extensively and accumulated over three years of industry experience. I was a research intern at [Google AI-ZÃ¼rich](https://ai.google/research/join-us/zurich/) working on question answering and fact verification during Winter 2019/20.
At [Facebook Conversational AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/conversational-ai) I worked on conversational information seeking (paper in-submission).
During summer 2018 I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research) in the [Information and Data Science Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/information-and-data-sciences/).
I was a data science intern at [Riot Games](https://youtu.be/jsRVA-HXZQc) and [Oracle/Datalogix](https://cloud.oracle.com/data-cloud).
Prior to starting my PhD, I was a data scientist at [Zillow Group/Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/about/careers/).

## Education

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of California at Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in December 2014.
During my undergraduate degree, I was a research assistant in [UC Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley's Astronomy Department](https://sites.google.com/site/cftdinfo/), and [Boise State University's Cryosphere Group](https://earth.boisestate.edu/cryogars/).

## Avalanche Education

As a bilingual avalanche safety instructor, I have taught hundreds of students throughout Idaho, Oregon, California, Colorado, Argentina, and Chile how to safely enjoy backcountry skiing and riding.
In my [blog](https://www.pedro.ai/blog), I've posted several of my lectures and written on [snowgeek.org](https://snowgeek.org) as well. Fun fact: I got my nickname "Pinguino" while teaching in Argentina (e.g., the favicon for my site is a penguin).
