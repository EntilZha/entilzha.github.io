Description: About Pedro Rodriguez

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland at College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/) advised by [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/).
My research interests center around developing machine learning models and datasets for knowledge-centered natural language processing.
I am interested in question answering, conversational information-seeking, and building better datasets.

I led the development of an [AI (Qanta)](https://qanta.org) system that defeated some of
the best [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl) players in the
world (see video below).
At present, I am a research intern at [Google AI in ZÃ¼rich](https://ai.google/research/join-us/zurich/).
I have also been a research intern at [Facebook Conversational AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/conversational-ai) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research) in the [Information and Data Science Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/information-and-data-sciences/).
I expect to graduate between December 2020 and May 2021.


I have also been a data science intern at [Riot Games](https://youtu.be/jsRVA-HXZQc) and [Oracle/Datalogix](https://cloud.oracle.com/data-cloud).
Prior to starting my PhD, I was a data scientist [Zillow Group/Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/about/careers/).
I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of California at Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in December 2014.
During my undergraduate degree, I was a research assistant in [UC Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley's Astronomy Department](https://sites.google.com/site/cftdinfo/), and [Boise State University's Cryosphere Group](https://earth.boisestate.edu/cryogars/).

I was also a founding member of the [Colorado Data Science Team](http://codata.colorado.edu).
In my free time I am a certified avalanche instructor for the [National Ski Patrol](http://nsp.org/), professional member of the American Avalanche Association, and an avid skier.
As a bilingual avalanche safety instructor, I have taught hundreds of students throughout Idaho, Oregon, California, Colorado, Argentina, and Chile how to safely enjoy backcountry skiing and riding.

## QANTA (our system) vs Top Quiz Bowl Team

Our system defeat a strong
team of human players 260-215 during our exhibition match at the 2017 Quiz Bowl
high school national championships. Note that we did not play against high
school students, the opposing team were comprised of tournament organizers,
many of which had themselves been previous champions in their high school or
college days.
