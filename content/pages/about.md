# PhD Research

The primary focus on my dissertation research has been in developing an [AI (QANTA)](https://github.com/Pinafore/qb) that can play [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl), a popular trivia game amongst school-aged and college students. This research is primarily funded by a [National Science Foundation (NSF) grant](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/projects/IIS-1320538.html) with additional funding from an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) research grant](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/). You can see our system defeat a strong team of human players 260-215 during our exhibition match at the 2017 Quiz Bowl high school national championships. Note that we did not play against high school students, the opposing team were comprised of helpers at the tournament, many of which had themselves been previous champions in their high school or college days.
