Description: About Pedro Rodriguez

I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the
[University of Maryland at College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/) advised by
[Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/). My research interests
center around developing machine learning (specifically deep learning) models
for natural language processing. I am interested in question answering, zero
and few shot learning, domain adaptation, and interpretability. I led the
development of an [AI (Qanta)](https://qanta.org) system that defeated some of
the best [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl) players in the
world (see video below).

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of
California at Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in December 2014. I have
worked as either a research scientist or data scientist at [Microsoft
Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research) in the [Information and
Data Science
Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/information-and-data-sciences/),
[Riot Games](https://youtu.be/jsRVA-HXZQc), [Zillow
Group/Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/about/careers/),
[Oracle](https://cloud.oracle.com/data-cloud), [UC Berkeley's
AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley's Astronomy
Department](https://sites.google.com/site/cftdinfo/), and [Boise State
University's Cryosphere Group](https://earth.boisestate.edu/cryogars/). I was
also a founding member of the [Colorado Data Science
Team](http://codata.colorado.edu). In my free time I am a certified avalanche
instructor for the [National Ski Patrol](http://nsp.org/), [professional member
of the American Avalanche Association](certified avalanche safety instructor
and), and an avid skier. As a bilingual avalanche safety instructor I taught hundreds of
students throughout Idaho, Oregon, California, Colorado, Argentina, and Chile how
to safely enjoy backcountry skiing and riding.

## QANTA (our system) vs Top Quiz Bowl Team

Our system defeat a strong
team of human players 260-215 during our exhibition match at the 2017 Quiz Bowl
high school national championships. Note that we did not play against high
school students, the opposing team were comprised of tournament organizers,
many of which had themselves been previous champions in their high school or
college days.
