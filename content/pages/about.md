I am a researcher at [FAIR Labs at Meta in Seattle](https://research.fb.com/people/rodriguez-pedro/).
I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland at College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/) titled ["Evaluating Machine Intelligence with Question Answering"](https://www.pedro.ai/static/publications/pedro_rodriguez_phd_thesis.pdf) in 2021.
I worked in the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) with [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/).

Thus far I have primarily worked in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but have recently started working in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Compiler Optimization as well.
Methodologically, my research focuses on improving how we evaluate machine learning and NLP models.
This encapsulates improving how we build datasets, improving evaluation methodology, creating better benchmarks, and making sure that these align with intended use.
Topically, I am interested in question answering, information retrieval, and RL for compiler optimization.

In my free time, I am an avid skier, climber, hiker, and violinist.

## Industry Experience

- I have been a researcher at Meta AI since April 2021
- Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies I interned extensively and accumulated over three years of industry experience.
- I was a research intern at [Google AI-ZÃ¼rich](https://ai.google/research/join-us/zurich/) working on question answering and fact verification during Winter 2019/20.
- At [Facebook Conversational AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/conversational-ai) I worked on conversational information seeking which resulted in an [EMNLP 2020 publication](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.655/).
- During summer 2018 I was a research intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research) in the [Information and Data Science Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/information-and-data-sciences/).
- I was a data science intern at [Riot Games](https://youtu.be/jsRVA-HXZQc) and [Oracle/Datalogix](https://cloud.oracle.com/data-cloud).
- Prior to starting my PhD, I was a data scientist at [Zillow Group/Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/about/careers/).

## Education

I defended my PhD dissertation in computer science at [University of Maryland at College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/) in April 2021.
I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of California at Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in December 2014.
During my undergraduate degree, I was a research assistant in [UC Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley's Astronomy Department](https://sites.google.com/site/cftdinfo/), and [Boise State University's Cryosphere Group](https://earth.boisestate.edu/cryogars/).

## Avalanche Education

As a bilingual avalanche safety instructor, I have taught hundreds of students throughout Idaho, Oregon, California, Colorado, Argentina, and Chile how to safely enjoy backcountry skiing and riding.
In my [blog](https://www.pedro.ai/blog), I've posted several of my lectures and written on [snowgeek.org](https://snowgeek.org) as well. Fun fact: I got my nickname "Pinguino" while teaching in Argentina (e.g., the favicon for my site is a penguin).
