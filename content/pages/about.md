Description: About Pedro Rodriguez

Pedro Rodriguez is a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://cs.colorado.edu/) advised by [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/). He is also the Team Captain of the [Colorado Data Science Team](http://codata.colorado.edu), a student lead organization that provides opportunities for students to practice applied data science at CU Boulder, helps government and non-profit entities with scare resources make best use of their data, and connect students and graduates with data science internships and job opportunities in the Boulder/Denver area.

His general research interests include large-scale machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). His current research is in the area of [Question Answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering) which seeks to build systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. This is primarily done through developing an [AI (QANTA)](https://github.com/Pinafore/qb) that can play [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl), a popular trivia game amongst school-aged and college students. This research is primarily funded by a [National Science Foundation (NSF) grant](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/projects/IIS-1320538.html) with additional funding from an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) research grant](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/).

Pedro earned his Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at [University of California at Berkeley](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/) in December 2015. During his undergraduate degree he was a research assistant in the Depeartment of Astronomy at the [Center for Time Domain Informatics](https://sites.google.com/site/cftdinfo/home/software), and in the [Berkeley AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu). Before starting his PhD, he worked at [Trulia](http://www.trulia.com/) as a Data Scientist where he worked on several projects which are now all in production at [trulia.com](https://trulia.com). His projects included crowdsourcing with [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/), architecting and building a production web api systems with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Swagger](http://swagger.io/)/[Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/)/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/),
and click through rate prediction at scale using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). In the summer of 2016 he worked at [Oracle Data Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/data-cloud) as a research intern architecting and developing next-generation architecture for data science at scale using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org), [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org), [Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org), [Packer](https://www.packer.io), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), and other tools.

Pedro is currently looking for research based internships for summer 2017.
