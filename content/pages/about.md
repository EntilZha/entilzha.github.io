I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland at College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/).
I work in the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) with [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/).
My research interests center around creating datasets and machine-learning models for knowledge-centered natural language processing.
In particular, I am interested in question answering and conversational information-seeking.
I expect to graduate from the PhD program between December 2020 and May 2021.
In my free time, I am an avid skier, climber, and hiker.

## Industry Experience

Throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies I have interned extensively and accumulated over three years of industry experience. I was a research intern at [Google AI-ZÃ¼rich](https://ai.google/research/join-us/zurich/) working on question answering and fact verification during Winter 2019/20.
At [Facebook Conversational AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/conversational-ai) I worked on conversational information seeking (paper in-submission).
During summer 2018 I was a resarch intern at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research) in the [Information and Data Science Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/information-and-data-sciences/).
I was a data science intern at [Riot Games](https://youtu.be/jsRVA-HXZQc) and [Oracle/Datalogix](https://cloud.oracle.com/data-cloud).
Prior to starting my PhD, I was a data scientist at [Zillow Group/Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/about/careers/).

## Education

I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of California at Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) in December 2014.
During my undergraduate degree, I was a research assistant in [UC Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/), [UC Berkeley's Astronomy Department](https://sites.google.com/site/cftdinfo/), and [Boise State University's Cryosphere Group](https://earth.boisestate.edu/cryogars/).

## QANTA (our system) vs Top Quiz Bowl Team

I led the development of an [AI (Qanta)](https://qanta.org) system that defeated some of
the best [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl) players in the
world (see video below).

Our system defeat a strong team of human players 260-215 during our exhibition match at the 2017 Quiz Bowl high school national championships.
Note that we did not play against high school students, the opposing team were comprised of tournament organizers, many of which had themselves been previous champions in their high school or college days. [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bYFqMINXayc)

### Avalanche Education

As a bilingual avalanche safety instructor, I have taught hundreds of students throughout Idaho, Oregon, California, Colorado, Argentina, and Chile how to safely enjoy backcountry skiing and riding.
In my [blog](https://www.pedro.ai/blog) I've posted several of my lectures and written on [snowgeek.org](https://snowgeek.org) as well. Fun fact: I got my nickname "Pinguino" while teaching in Argentina (e.g., the favicon for my site is a penguin).
