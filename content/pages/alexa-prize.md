This research pages contains supplemental material for our Alexa Prize application. Below you will find a short description and example of Twenty Question and Botticelli gameplay, a bibliography of our own and other's research we will use in our project, and sample videos of a question answering AI we work on playing Quiz Bowl against humans.

# Twenty Question and Boticelli Game Description

[Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions) and [Botticelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botticelli_(game)) are two popular trivia games where the basic game play consists of:

1. One person becomes the chooser and selects an entity, but does not reveal it to the other player
2. One more more other people becomes the guessers and through a questions with yes or no answers try to determine the entity that the chooser selected

In Twenty Questions the guessers are allowed a maximum of twenty questions in which to determine the entity. In Botticelli guessers must earn the right to ask a question by stumping the chooser. Below is an example of Botticelli gameplay and the additional rules.

For example, suppose that the chooser selects Patrick Stewart since they can only choose people. They then announce the first letter of the person's last name is "S", and a guesser thinks of two things:

1. A characteristic they would like to ask about
2. A person that matches the characteristic and whose last name starts with "S"

For instance, the guesser might be thinking about William Shatner and ask "Are you an Actor?". The chooser then has three options:

1. Think of a person other than their own who is an actor and name them. For example, they could say "No, I am not Brent Spiner"
2. If the only person they can think of that satisfies the description is their chosen person, then the guesser wins the game
3. If they can't think of someone who fits the description at all then, the guesser can ask a normal yes/no question

Below is some extended gameplay of the above example for illustration:

* Guesser: Are you an actor?
* Chooser: No, I am not Brent Spiner
* Guesser: Are you a man?
* Chooser: No, I am not Barack Obama
* Guesser: Are you the actor that played Riker in The Next Generation?
* Chooser: Sorry, I don't recall who played him, go ahead and ask your yes/no question
* Guesser: Is your person bald?
* Chooser: Yes
* Guesser: Are you an actor for a bald captain?
* Chooser: Yes, I am Patrick Stewart
