Description: Presentation slides from CU Boulder STEMinar talk on question answering AI

On March 3, 2016 I gave a talk as part of the [CU Boulder STEMinar](https://sites.google.com/a/colorado.edu/steminar/) talk series. The talk was aimed at a general STEM audience, and discussed our [research's group work](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/projects/IIS-1320538.html) on creating an artificial intelligence for playing [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl). The talk covers basic machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, representing text numerically, deep learning, and question answering.
