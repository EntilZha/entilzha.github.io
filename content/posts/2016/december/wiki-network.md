Description: Video presentation of a new network science based technique inspired by the Wikipedia Game for question answering.

In this video talk I discuss recent work which uses a network science technique inspired by the [Wikipedia Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game) to answer trivia questions. This was also a final course project for [Aaron Clauset's Network Models course](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5352/)
