Description: Presentation slides from CU Boulder lecture on AI for trivia games

On October 25, 2016 I gave a guest lecture to the machine learning course at CU Boulder. The lecture was an adapted version of my [STEMinar talk earlier this year](/blog/2016/03/07/qanta-ai-talk/), and aimed at an audience of students just getting into machine learning.The lecture highlights our [research's group work](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/projects/IIS-1320538.html) on creating an artificial intelligence for playing [Quiz Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz_bowl). The lecture covers the AI techniques used in our system such as machine learning, deep learning, NLP, reinforcement learning, and others.
